# SNAKES AND LADDER GAME
The Snakes and Ladders game in C++ is a simple console-based project that simulates the classic board game. The game is played on a board with 100 squares, where players roll a dice to move forward. If they land on a ladder, they climb up, but if they land on a snake, they slide down. The objective is to reach the final square (100) before other players.

# Features:
âœ… Dice Roll Simulation (Random number generation)
âœ… Snakes and Ladders Placement (Predefined positions)
âœ… Turn-Based Gameplay (For multiple players)
âœ… Winning Condition (First player to reach 100 wins)

This project is a great way to practice arrays, functions, loops, and object-oriented programming (OOP) in C++ while creating an engaging game. Do you need the full code or an explanation of specific parts? ðŸš€
