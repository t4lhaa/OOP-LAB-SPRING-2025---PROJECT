# SNAKES AND LADDER GAME
The Snakes and Ladders game in C++ is a simple GUI-based project that simulates the classic board game. The game is played on a board with 100 squares, where players roll a dice to move forward. If they land on a ladder, they climb up, but if they land on a snake, they slide down. The objective is to reach the final square (100) before other players.
